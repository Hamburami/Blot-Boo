BUGS

- Cant click on part of text to edit it; moving cursor with arrow keys and typing does not edit section but instead tacks on char to end of thought
- Clear thoughts button doesn't work, it should archive
- Enter key on blank spot creates a new thought
- Right clicking on a thought starts dragging
- shouldn't move cursor/thoughts position beyond screen
- connections don't quite line up on corners or have the right direction/shortest path


    Visual
    - lines of connections are half resolution
